This dually enables them to buy and fly larger rocket engines while providing the invaluable pedigree to be applied to other rocketry laboratory projects.",

                The UChicago Space Programâ€™s Rocketry Laboratory is split into two projects: High Powered Rocketry certification and Spaceport America Cup Launch Competition. Developed and led entirely by UChicago undergraduates with advisors from the Northern Illinois Rocketry Association and alums, this pipeline ensures students gain the hands-on rocketry experience they need to compete competitively in launch competitions.
